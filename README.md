Printing images in MS Paint

- Are you sick and tired of your Windows computer being able to *load images in under an hour*?
- Do you wish for a horribly *unoptimized* image file format that is substantially *larger* and arguably *harder to read* than any other image file format?
- Are you sick of your images having *detail* and also *colour*?
- Do you think MS Paint should behave more like *malware*?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, what's wrong with you?

Regardless, look no further than this easy to use script that prints images pixel by pixel into MS paint.

It has the best features: 
  * Takes the difficult task of drawing in MS Paint away from the user
    * Also happens to take away all control from the user while drawing
  * Captures and prints a picture once it detects a face
  * Can print in fewer than 24 hours (I think)
  * Prints in grayscale with unprecedented amounts of detail
    * Detail is optional, as the print can be done faster in just black and white 
    * Amounts of detail may be precedented, research is yet to be done
  
  
  
  
__FAQ__

__How was it made?__
      Using AutoHotKey scripts and OpenCV functionality, all bundled together in a poorly written python package.
      
__How can I use it?__
      Setup is quick and easy in order to be able to use this script! All you need is: 
* AutoHotKey.exe downloaded specifically into the hardcoded filepath for the subprocess handler 
* A couple cool python libraries (opencv, PIL, numpy, subprocess, win32api, autohotkey, and also every other python library) 
* A 1920x1080 screen resolution (currently, because I need to not hardcode it)
* MS Paint, initialized with at least a 640x480 canvas, fullscreen and organized the way I have it...
* A notable lack of dignity
